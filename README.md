# Bookmarks Manager

## Overview

This extension is used to record the time of a video and create a bookmark with the time on YouTube.

## How to use

1. Use keyboard shortcut `CTRL + CMD + V` (`V` for volleyball).
2. The extension will open a popup where you can add description and tags.
3. When you press "bookmark moment", the extension will create a bookmark with the time and the description.

**Note:** Currently, the popup doesn't close after the bookmark is created. Close it manually.
