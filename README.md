# Bookmarks Manager

## Overview

This extension is used to record the time of a video and create a bookmark with the time on YouTube.

## Why

I watch volleyball a lot, and was saving manually youtube videos with timestamps. It was happening so often, that I decided to write a Chrome extension for that.

## How to use

1. Use keyboard shortcut `CTRL + CMD + V` (`V` for volleyball).
2. The extension will open a popup where you can add description and tags.
3. When you press "bookmark moment", the extension will create a bookmark with the time and the description.

## Disclaimers

I've made solely for my own use. It's realy opinionated:
- It saves bookmarks in a folder called "Volleybal Journal".
- It formats the bookmark title as [tags] | [description].
- It only works on YouTube.
- I cound'nt make the popup close, and I wasn't patient enough to fix it. Close it manually.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a way to close the popup after the bookmark is created.
- [ ] Add a way to choose the folder where the bookmark will be created.
- [ ] Add a way to choose the way the bookmark title will be formatted.
